	  <h1 id="Who-owns-hard-stone-casino-Arsenal-FC"><a href="#Who-owns-hard-stone-casino-Arsenal-FC" class="headerlink" title="Who owns hard stone casino Arsenal FC?"></a>Who owns hard stone casino Arsenal FC?</h1><p>Arsenal FC is an English football club based in Highbury, London. The club, who were founded in 1886, play their home games at the Emirates Stadium and are currently one of the most successful clubs in England, having won 13 First Division and Premier League titles and 10 FA Cups.</p>
<p>The current owner of Arsenal FC is Stan Kroenke, an American businessman who bought a majority stake in the club in 2011. Kroenke also owns NFL side the Los Angeles Rams, NBA team the Denver Nuggets and MLS franchise Colorado Rapids. As well as owning Arsenal, Kroenke is also a major shareholder in UK broadcaster Sky Sports.</p>
<p>There has been some criticism of Kroenke’s ownership of Arsenal, with some fans feeling that he hasn’t invested enough money into the club and that he isn’t interested in winning trophies. However, Kroenke has shown that he is committed to Arsenal by increasing his stake in the club on several occasions and by building a new 60,000-seater stadium for the team.</p>
<p>Whether you agree with him or not, Stan Kroenke is the owner of one of English football’s biggest clubs and looks likely to remain so for many years to come.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-value-of-the-club"><a href="#What-is-the-value-of-the-club" class="headerlink" title="What is the value of the club?"></a>What is the value of the club?</h1><p>The value of the club is often a topic of discussion for both fans and those in the business world. The problem that we face when trying to assign a value to a club is that it is not simply about the bricks and mortar, or even the players on the pitch. There are intangible factors at play which make it difficult to put a price on a football club.</p>
<p>In order to try and understand the value of a club, we first have to look at what goes into making it up. The most obvious assets of a club are its players. However, these can be quickly depreciated if they are sold. Players can also be poached by other clubs relatively easily, so they are not always a guaranteed source of income.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are the facilities that the club owns – the stadium, training ground and other associated infrastructure. While these assets may be worth money, they are not liquid and cannot easily be turned into cash. They may also require significant maintenance and upkeep costs.</p>
<p>Another key factor in a football club’s value is its brand. This includes things such as how well-known the team is around the world, how popular its players are, as well as any marketing deals or sponsorships that it has in place. All of these factors can contribute to generating revenue for the club.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the less tangible elements which can be harder to measure but no less important. These include things like fan loyalty and “club culture”. A team which enjoys strong support from its fans will usually be worth more than one which does not. This is because supporters represent an important asset for clubs, as they can help generate matchday revenue through ticket sales and merchandise sales.</p>
<p>With all of these factors in mind, it is clear that trying to assign a precise value to a football club is no easy task. Nevertheless, people have tried to do just that and there have been some estimates made over the years. In 2006, English football magazine FourFourTwo estimated that Manchester United was worth £1 billion pounds while Liverpool was valued at £500 million pounds. In 2013, Forbes Magazine estimated that Real Madrid was worth $3.3 billion dollars while Barcelona was worth $3 billion dollars. More recently, in 2016 Deloitte valued Manchester United at $2.8 billion pounds while Liverpool was worth $1.49 billion pounds.</p>
<p>So what is the current value of your team? It’s tough to say for sure but whatever it may be, remember that it is not simply about what you see on the pitch or on paper – there are many other important factors at play too</p>

They want to bring in the best players, create a world-class stadium, and win championships. They also want to make sure that the club is profitable and sustainable for many years to come.</p>

<h1 id="How-happy-are-fans-with-the-current-ownership"><a href="#How-happy-are-fans-with-the-current-ownership" class="headerlink" title="How happy are fans with the current ownership?"></a>How happy are fans with the current ownership?</h1><p>Since the purchase of the Carolina Panthers by David Tepper in May of 2018, fans have had mixed emotions. Some are happy that the team has a new owner who is committed to keeping the team in Carolina, while others are disappointed with the high price tag and what they see as a lack of transparency from Tepper. In this article, we’ll take a closer look at how happy fans are with the current ownership.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by Public Policy Polling in September of 2018 found that 45% of Panthers fans approve of the job David Tepper is doing as owner of the team, while 32% disapprove. 23% said they were unsure. This indicates that there is a lot of room for improvement, but also that Tepper has not yet lost the support of a majority of fans.</p>
<p>Some factors that may be contributing to fan happiness (or unhappiness) include Tepper’s commitment to keeping the team in Carolina, his involvement in the community, and his spending on players and coaches. Let’s take a closer look at each of these.</p>
<p>Tepper has made it clear that he is committed to keeping the team in Carolina, which some fans see as a sign that he cares about them. He has also been involved in the community since purchasing the team, sponsoring events and hosting meet and greets. His spending on players and coaches has also been welcomed by many fans. In particular, his decision to retain head coach Ron Rivera after a disappointing season in 2018 was well-received.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some fans have disliked Tepper’s high price tag for the team and his lack of transparency. For example, he has refused to disclose how much money he paid for the team or how much he makes in profits each year. Some people see this as an attempt by Tepper to hide information from taxpayers who helped finance stadium renovations in Charlotte.</p>
<p>Overall, it appears that most Panthers fans are happy with David Tepper as owner. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly when it comes to transparency and community involvement.</p>
