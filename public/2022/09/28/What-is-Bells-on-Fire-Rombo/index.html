<p>There are also different boards to play on, with different layouts and obstacles. In order to light up a bell, players must connect at least three adjacent bells of the same color.

<p>There are also special bells in the game which can be used to your advantage. The star bell will randomly turn all nearby bells into the same color, while the clock bell will add time to the clock. Use these bells wisely to help you complete each level as quickly as possible!</p>
