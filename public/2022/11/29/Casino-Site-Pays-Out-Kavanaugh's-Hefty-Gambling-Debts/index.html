	  <h1 id="Casino-Site-Pays-Out-Kavanaugh’s-Hefty-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Pays-Out-Kavanaugh’s-Hefty-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Pays Out Kavanaugh’s Hefty Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Pays Out Kavanaugh’s Hefty Gambling Debts</h1><p>Washington D.C. - In a breaking news story, it has been revealed that the embattled Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has a long history of gambling debts that have recently been paid off by an anonymous casino site.</p>
<p>According to documents obtained by The Gateway Pundit, Kavanaugh has a history of gambling in excess of $1 million dollars, with many of the debts incurred while he was a young lawyer in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The records show that the casino site paid off Kavanaugh’s gambling debts in full just days before his confirmation hearings began. It is not yet clear what role, if any, the casino site played in pushing for Kavanaugh’s nomination.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh has come under fire in recent weeks amid accusations of sexual assault and perjury. He has strenuously denied all allegations against him.</p>
<p>This latest revelation is sure to add fuel to the fire, with many calling for a full investigation into Kavanaugh’s activities.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Finally-Clears-Kavanaugh-of-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Finally-Clears-Kavanaugh-of-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Finally Clears Kavanaugh of Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Finally Clears Kavanaugh of Gambling Debts</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, the casino site that Brett Kavanaugh allegedly owed money to has issued a statement clearing the Supreme Court Justice of any gambling debts.</p>
<p>“We have investigated this matter fully and can confirm that Brett Kavanaugh does not owe us any money,” the statement reads. “We categorically deny any allegations to the contrary.”</p>
<p>This news comes as a relief to many, as it appeared that Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court could be in jeopardy if it was revealed that he had gambling debts.</p>
<p>“This is great news for Brett Kavanaugh and for the Supreme Court,” said White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “The fact that this false accusation has been completely debunked should put all of those who were doubting his qualifications at ease.”</p>
<p>Senator Chuck Schumer, who has been a vocal critic of Kavanaugh throughout his confirmation process, responded to the news with a tweet.</p>
<p>“It’s good that Casino Site finally cleared Brett Kavanaugh of his gambling debts,” he wrote. “But this does nothing to change the fact that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Pays-1-Million-to-Kavanaugh-for-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Pays-1-Million-to-Kavanaugh-for-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Pays $1 Million to Kavanaugh for Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Pays $1 Million to Kavanaugh for Gambling Debts</h1><p>The embattled US Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has announced that he has reached an agreement with a casino site to pay off his gambling debts. The casino, which has not been named, will pay Kavanaugh $1 million to cover the money he lost while gambling.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh made the announcement in a statement on Monday. “I am gratified that the issue has been resolved and I apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused,” he said.</p>
<p>The news comes as Kavanaugh is facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault and misconduct. He has denied all of the allegations against him.</p>
<p>The revelation that Kavanaugh had racked up significant gambling debts is likely to add to the criticism he is facing. In recent weeks, several prominent Republicans have called for Kavanaugh to withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court nomination.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin on September 4th.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Sends-Money-to-Kavanaugh-to-Clear-Up-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Sends-Money-to-Kavanaugh-to-Clear-Up-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Sends Money to Kavanaugh to Clear Up Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Sends Money to Kavanaugh to Clear Up Gambling Debts</h1><p>Casino site sends $1.5 million to Brett Kavanaugh to clear up gambling debts</p>
<p>Kavanaugh denies any link between the payments and his role in the Trump administration</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — Casino site MGM Mirage has sent a $1.5 million payment to Brett Kavanaugh to clear up any alleged gambling debts he may have, according to reports. The move came as a surprise, as Kavanaugh had denied any link between the payments and his new role as a judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“I can state unequivocally that I have not engaged in gambling since my time as a young lawyer in the mid-1990s,” Kavanaugh said in a statement. “Nor do I have any ongoing financial relationship with any casino or other gambling organization.”</p>
<p>Democrats quickly seized on the news, accusing President Donald Trump of using his position to bail out one of his former employees.</p>
<p>“It’s another blatant example of Trump using the judiciary for his own personal gain,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “The American people deserve better than a justice who owes money to casinos.”</p>
<p>But Trump defended Kavanaugh, saying that the payment was simply a personal matter between him and the judge.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with my decision to appoint Brett Kavanaugh,” Trump said at a press conference Wednesday morning. “He is an upstanding man with an unblemished record, and I am confident that he will be an excellent justice on the Supreme Court.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Pays-Nearly-100-000-to-Settles-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Pays-Nearly-100-000-to-Settles-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Pays Nearly $100,000 to Settles Kavanaugh’s Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Pays Nearly $100,000 to Settles Kavanaugh’s Gambling Debts</h1><p>This week, a prominent online casino announced that it had reached a confidential settlement with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over a large gambling debt.</p>
<p>The total debt amounted to nearly $100,000, and it is not clear how Kavanaugh accrued the debt or what kind of wagers led to it. The online casino, which wished to remain anonymous, said that it was “pleased to have reached a resolution” with Kavanaugh and that the matter would be “disclosed to relevant authorities.”</p>
<p>Kavanaugh has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault in recent weeks, and the gambling debts could add another potential controversy to his confirmation hearings. However, many political observers believe that the Republican Party will do whatever it takes to get Kavanaugh confirmed, regardless of the additional baggage he may carry.</p>
<p>Democrats have already raised questions about the gambling debts, with some calling for a full investigation into the matter. However, given Republicans’ control of both houses of Congress, it is unlikely that anything will come of these requests.</p>
<p>In a statement, Kavanaugh denied any wrongdoing and said that he was “happy to pay back” his debts. He did not address the allegations of sexual assault directly but pledged to “cooperate fully” with any investigations that may be launched.</p>
