<p>After a goalless first half, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang put the Gunners ahead early in the second, only for Robert Lewandowski to level proceedings soon after. But substitute Alexandre Lacazette won it for Arsenal late on, ensuring they remain unbeaten this summer.</p>
<p>Manager Unai Emery made 10 changes to the side that started against Chelsea last weekend, with goalkeeper Petr Cech among those given a run-out. There were also starts for summer signings Lucas Torreira and Bernd Leno, who played the full game.</p>
<p>The hosts had the better of the first half, but chances were at a premium. Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was called into action just once, palming away a powerful effort from Kingsley Coman.</p>
<p>Bayern took the lead shortly after the interval when Aubameyang miscued his attempted clearance and Lewandowski was on hand to put the ball into an empty net. However, Arsenal hit back just two minutes later when Lacazette found space in the area to score his third goal of pre-season.</p>
<p>Both sides created chances as the game went on, but it was Lacazette who proved decisive with five minutes remaining, firing home after being teed up by Henrikh Mkhitaryan.</p>
<p>Arsenal now head to Sweden for their final pre-season fixture against Lazio on Saturday before opening their Premier League campaign at home to Manchester City a week later.</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-continue-their-hot-streak-in-Sin-City"><a href="#Arsenal-continue-their-hot-streak-in-Sin-City" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal continue their hot streak in Sin City"></a>Arsenal continue their hot streak in Sin City</h1><p>Arsenal came into their match against a tough Vegas Golden Knights side riding high on a six-game winning streak. The hot streak continued as the Gunners downed the Knights 3-1.</p>
<p>Arsenal’s Offense Came Alive</p>
<p>The Golden Knights came into the game with the third-best defense in the league, but they were no match for Arsenal’s high-powered offense. The Gunners scored two goals in the first period and never looked back.</p>
<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang opened the scoring early in the first period with his 18th goal of the season. Then, midway through the period, Alexandre Lacazette doubled Arsenal’s lead with his 10th goal of the season. The Gunners were able to hold onto their lead throughout the rest of the game.</p>
<p>Golden Knights Struggle to Score</p>
<p>The Golden Knights were only able to muster one goal in the game, and it came late in the third period. William Karlsson scored his 20th goal of the season to cut Arsenal’s lead to 2-1. However, it was too little, too late for Vegas.</p>
<p>Arsenal’s Defense was Impressive</p>
<p>Although Vegas was only able to score one goal, they had plenty of opportunities throughout the game. The Golden Knights outshot Arsenal 33-28, but Petr Cech was up to the task. He made 32 saves and earned his fifth shutout of the season.</p>
<p>Arsenal’s hot streak continues as they win their seventh consecutive game 3-1 over a tough Vegas Golden Knights side. The Golden Knights came into the game with one of the best defenses in NHL but were no match for Arsenal’s high powered offense which scored two goals in first period and never looked back. Pierre Emerick Aubameyang opened scoring early in first period with his 18th goal of season then midway through first period Alexandre Lacazette doubled Arsenal lead with his 10th goal of season. The Golden Knights were only able to muster one goal William Karlsson scored his 20thgoal of season to cut Arsenal lead to 2-1 but it was too little too late. Although Vegas outshot Arsenal 33-28 Petr Cech was up to task making 32 saves earning him fifth shutout this season</p>
<h1 id="Gunners-extend-their-unbeaten-record-in-Nevada"><a href="#Gunners-extend-their-unbeaten-record-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="Gunners extend their unbeaten record in Nevada"></a>Gunners extend their unbeaten record in Nevada</h1><p>The Gunners made it three wins from three in the early stages of their pre-season campaign with a comprehensive victory against the Nevada Wolf Pack.</p>
<p>Despite falling behind to an early goal, Arsenal responded with a flurry of goals in the second half. Eddie Nketiah led the way for the Gunners, scoring a hat-trick, while there were also goals for Emile Smith Rowe and Reiss Nelson.</p>
<p>It was a good workout for new signing Dani Ceballos who played for 67 minutes before being replaced by Granit Xhaka.</p>
<p>The result means that Arsenal have now extended their unbeaten record in Nevada to eight games.</p>
<h1 id="Another-big-win-for-Arsene-Wenger’s-men-in-America"><a href="#Another-big-win-for-Arsene-Wenger’s-men-in-America" class="headerlink" title="Another big win for Arsene Wenger’s men in America"></a>Another big win for Arsene Wenger’s men in America</h1><p>Arsenal FC started their pre-season tour of America with a hard-fought victory against the Colorado Rapids. The Gunners had to come from behind to take the win, as Swedish striker John Guidetti gave the home side the lead midway through the first half.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the second half that Arsenal started to show their quality, as new signings Alexandre Lacazette and Sead Kolasinac both scored within minutes of each other. This sealed the victory for Wenger’s side, and they will be looking to build on this momentum in their next game against Bayern Munich.</p>
<p>The match against Bayern Munich will be a tough test for Arsenal, but they have already shown that they are capable of beating some of Europe’s top teams. Wenger will be hoping that his new signings can help the team make a run for the Premier League title this season.</p>
<p>Arsenal fans will also be excited to see their new captain Laurent Koscielny back in action after recovering from injury. Koscielny is one of the most important players in Arsenal’s squad, and his return will give the team a major boost ahead of the new season.</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal-show-no-signs-of-slowing-down-as-they-take-on-Harrah’s"><a href="#Arsenal-show-no-signs-of-slowing-down-as-they-take-on-Harrah’s" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal show no signs of slowing down as they take on Harrah’s"></a>Arsenal show no signs of slowing down as they take on Harrah’s</h1><p>Arsenal 2-0 Harrah’s: The Gunners kicked off their preseason tour of the United States with a convincing victory over the Harrah’s casino team. Goals from new signings Sead Kolasinac and Alexandre Lacazette were enough to give Arsenal the win, despite playing a somewhat experimental side.</p>
<p>The match was Arsenal’s first since losing to Chelsea in the FA Cup final, and they looked keen to make up for that disappointment. Kolasinac in particular was impressive, demonstrating his power and tenacity in both defence and attack.</p>
<p>Lacazette also looked sharp, scoring within minutes of coming on as a second-half substitute. The Frenchman will be eager to get off to a good start in his first season with the club, and this performance will have given him plenty of confidence.</p>
<p>Arsenal head coach Arsene Wenger gave several young players an opportunity to impress, including 18-year-old Reiss Nelson. The winger showed plenty of promise, terrorising the Harrah’s defence with his speed and trickery.</p>
<p>Wenger will be pleased with his side’s performance overall, particularly given that it came against what is essentially a scratch team. Arsenal face Bayern Munich next week in their next preseason fixture, and they will be looking to replicate this form against Champions League opposition.</p>
