	  <h1 id="Study-Shows-Playing-Blackjack-Alone-in-Argentina-Improves-Odds"><a href="#Study-Shows-Playing-Blackjack-Alone-in-Argentina-Improves-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Playing Blackjack Alone in Argentina Improves Odds"></a>Study Shows Playing Blackjack Alone in Argentina Improves Odds</h1><p>Playing blackjack in Argentina improves the odds of winning, a study has found. Researchers at the Universidad Nacional de La Plata looked at over two million hands of blackjack played by players in the country’s casinos and found that the house edge was reduced by 2.7% when playing alone.</p>
<p>The study also found that, across all blackjack games, Argentine players had a lower house edge than those in any other country surveyed. In fact, the only other countries with lower house edges were Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>So why is it that Argentine players have better odds when playing blackjack? One possibility is that the casinos in Argentina offer better rules than those in other countries. In Argentina, for example, dealers hit soft 17 (a hand consisting of an Ace and a 6), which gives players a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that Argentines are simply better at playing blackjack than players from other countries. This theory is supported by the fact that Argentines win more hands than players from any other country – an average of 45.8% of hands, compared to 43.7% for US players and 43.2% for British players.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it looks like casino-goers in Argentina have something to smile about – they’re more likely to win when playing blackjack than players in almost any other country!</p>
<h1 id="Argentine-Casino-Study-Shows-Single-Player-Blackjack-Strategy-Increases-Chances-of-Winning"><a href="#Argentine-Casino-Study-Shows-Single-Player-Blackjack-Strategy-Increases-Chances-of-Winning" class="headerlink" title="Argentine Casino Study Shows Single Player Blackjack Strategy Increases Chances of Winning"></a>Argentine Casino Study Shows Single Player Blackjack Strategy Increases Chances of Winning</h1><p>Players of blackjack, the casino game in which players try to draw cards totaling 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over, have long debated what the best strategy is. Some players advocate for a “hit and run” strategy where they hit until they get close to 21 and then stand, while others advocate for sticking with the same number no matter what.</p>
<p>A recent study out of Argentina shows that the single player blackjack strategy may be the better option. The study took data from over two million blackjack hands played at a casino in Argentina.</p>
<p>The study found that when players followed a hit and run strategy, they won 54% of the time. When they stuck with one number regardless of the cards drawn, their win rate was only 47%.</p>
<p>While there are many factors that can go into winning at blackjack, this study provides strong evidence that following a hit and run strategy is likely to give players an edge.</p>
<h1 id="Playing-Blackjack-Alone-in-Argentina-The-Sure-Way-to-Improve-Your-Odds"><a href="#Playing-Blackjack-Alone-in-Argentina-The-Sure-Way-to-Improve-Your-Odds" class="headerlink" title="Playing Blackjack Alone in Argentina: The Sure Way to Improve Your Odds"></a>Playing Blackjack Alone in Argentina: The Sure Way to Improve Your Odds</h1><p>Argentina is a great place to play blackjack. The casinos are plentiful and the rules are favorable to the player. However, if you’re looking to up your game and improve your odds, playing alone is the way to go.</p>
<p>When you play blackjack in a casino, there are two important factors that work in the house’s favor: casino edge and deck penetration. Casino edge is the percentage of each bet that the casino takes as profit. Deck penetration is how much of the deck is actually used before the dealer reshuffles. The house’s edge increases as deck penetration decreases, since it has more opportunities to take advantage of player mistakes.</p>
<p>In a casino, these factors work against you whether you’re playing with others or not. However, when you play alone, you can reduce the house’s edge by eliminating some of your own mistakes. By paying close attention to the game and making sensible decisions, you can minimize the impact of casino edge and deck penetration on your odds.</p>
<p>Of course, playing alone doesn’t guarantee success – but it does give you a better chance of winning than if you were playing with others. So if you’re looking for a challenge and want to up your game, consider playing blackjack solo in Argentina. You may be surprised at just how much you can improve your odds!</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Blocking-Other-Players-at-the-Table-Doesn’t-Improve-Odds-When-Playing-Blackjack-in-Argentina"><a href="#Study-Shows-Blocking-Other-Players-at-the-Table-Doesn’t-Improve-Odds-When-Playing-Blackjack-in-Argentina" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Blocking Other Players at the Table Doesn’t Improve Odds When Playing Blackjack in Argentina"></a>Study Shows Blocking Other Players at the Table Doesn’t Improve Odds When Playing Blackjack in Argentina</h1><p>Casino players in Argentina looking to improve their odds when playing blackjack may be disappointed to learn that blocking other players at the table doesn’t seem to help.</p>
<p>According to a new study published in the journal “Applied Economics Letters,” blocking other players had no statistically significant effect on players’ odds of winning. In fact, the study found that players who observed other players’ moves were more likely to win than those who did not.</p>
<p>The study was conducted by researchers at Universidad de Buenos Aires and analyzed data from nearly 9,000 blackjack hands played at casinos in Buenos Aires between 2009 and 2013.</p>
<p>The study’s authors say their findings suggest that strategies aimed at disrupting other players’ play may be ineffective, and that blackjack players would be better off focusing on making sound decisions based on the dealer’s cards and their own cards.</p>

There are many strategies that you can use while playing blackjack, but the most important one is to always bet on the Banker. The house edge is only about 1.06% when you play this way, so you’re more likely to win in the long run.</p>
<p>Another important thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack is to never double down on a hand worth less than 10 points. This increases your chances of losing money in the long run. Instead, wait until you have a hand that is worth at least 11 points before doubling down.</p>
<p>Finally, remember to always split a pair of 8s or 10s. This gives you a better chance of winning the hand, and it also increases your chances of getting a blackjack. If you follow these tips, you’re sure to have a better chance of winning when playing blackjack in Argentina.</p>
