	  <h1 id="How-to-Play-Blackjack-with-Bacon"><a href="#How-to-Play-Blackjack-with-Bacon" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Blackjack with Bacon"></a>How to Play Blackjack with Bacon</h1><p>Blackjack is a popular casino game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. In this game, players attempt to draw cards with a combined value of 21, or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding this total. If the player goes over 21, they “bust” and lose the hand. The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a higher total than them, without busting.</p>
<p>In blackjack, cards numbered 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points. A king, queen, or jack (also known as a “court card”) is worth 10 points. The game can be played with between one and eight decks of cards, though most casinos use six decks.</p>
<p>To begin a hand of blackjack, the player places an initial bet in the designated area on the table. The dealer then distributes two cards to each player, and one card face-up to themselves. In some variants of blackjack, if either the player or dealer has an ace as their first card, they may choose to take an additional card instead of standing (playing out their hand with two cards).</p>
<p>After each player has been given their two cards, the dealer turns over their hidden card. If the dealer’s total is 17 or more, they must stand; if their total is 16 or less, they must hit (take another card). If the dealer’s first card is an ace, they may choose to hit or stand depending on the value of their second card. If the dealer busts (exceeds 21), all players still in the hand win regardless of their own hand value.</p>
<p>The player then decides whether to hit or stand based on their own two-card hand total and the dealer’s exposed card. If they decide to hit and obtain a third card that brings their total over 21, they bust just like if they had exceeded 21 with the first two cards. If they stand with a total of 21 or more after hitting (e.g., drew an ace and 10), they win automatically unless the dealer also has 21 (a “push”). Otherwise, if their total falls short of 21 after hitting, they lose automatically unless the dealer busts (in which case it would be a push).</p>
<p>In order to make things interesting and give players another strategic decision to make during play, many blackjack tables offer side bets. These are wagers placed in addition to ones on the main game that pay out based on different criteria such as whether your first two cards are a pair or whether your final hand contains at least one ace natural blackjack). Some side bets even have worse odds than simply betting on black or red at roulette! So be sure you understand how any side bet works before putting your hard-earned cash down on it!</p>

<p>Second, both blackjack and bacon are versatile. You can enjoy them for breakfast, lunch or dinner – or any time in between!</p>

<p>Last but not least, both blackjack and bacon are relatively healthy. While they’re not saintly by any means, both activities offer some nutritional benefits that you can feel good about.</p>
<p>So the next time you’re looking for something tasty to enjoy, consider pairing up some blackjack and bacon!</p>
<h1 id="A-Card-Game-with-a-Side-of-Bacon"><a href="#A-Card-Game-with-a-Side-of-Bacon" class="headerlink" title="A Card Game with a Side of Bacon"></a>A Card Game with a Side of Bacon</h1><p>Introducing Bacon &amp; Cards, the card game that’s perfect for any occasion! Whether you’re looking to kill some time with friends or family, or you just love bacon, this game is sure to entertain.</p>
<p>To begin, each player is dealt five cards. The remaining cards are placed face down in the middle of the players to create a draw deck. The player who is left of the dealer starts the game by flipping over the top card of their draw deck. The player on their left then flips over the next card. This process continues until one of two things happens:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The card flipped over matches the card previously flipped over, in which case the player who flipped it over takes another turn.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The card flipped over doesn’t match the previous one, in which case the player flips over another card from their deck and play passes to the left.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The goal of the game is to remove all of the cards from your hand. When you remove a card, it can be placed onto one of two piles in front of you: a bacon pile or a regular pile. The bacon pile can only have cards that are either all bacon or all regular (no mixing). If at any point you are unable to place a card, then you must draw from your draw deck and continue playing.</p>
<p>The first player to remove all of their cards from their hand wins!</p>
<p>But what makes Bacon &amp; Cards even more fun is that there’s a bit of bacon involved. Whenever a player removes a bacon card from their hand, they get to eat a slice of delicious bacon! Mmmmmm….bacon….</p>
<h1 id="Bacon-Makes-Everything-Better-Even-Blackjack"><a href="#Bacon-Makes-Everything-Better-Even-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Bacon Makes Everything Better: Even Blackjack!"></a>Bacon Makes Everything Better: Even Blackjack!</h1><p>There’s something about bacon that just makes everything taste better. But did you know that it also makes blackjack better?</p>
<p>That’s right – bacon can give you a winning edge at the casino table. And it’s not just because of the amazing flavor. There’s science behind it too.</p>
<p>Bacon is high in fat and protein, which means that it helps to slow the absorption of sugar into your bloodstream. This is important when playing blackjack, because having a steady blood sugar level is key to avoiding mistakes.</p>
<p>In addition, bacon is a good source of vitamin B6. This vitamin helps to control stress levels, which can also lead to mistakes while playing blackjack.</p>
<p>So next time you hit the casino, make sure to bring some bacon along with you! It could be the difference between winning and losing.</p>
<h1 id="Bringing-Home-the-Bacon-at-the-Blackjack-Table"><a href="#Bringing-Home-the-Bacon-at-the-Blackjack-Table" class="headerlink" title="Bringing Home the Bacon at the Blackjack Table"></a>Bringing Home the Bacon at the Blackjack Table</h1><p>In order to be successful when playing blackjack, one must first understand the game. There are a number of basic rules that govern how the game is played, which players should review before sitting down at a table.</p>
<p>In blackjack, each player is dealt two cards face up, and the dealer is dealt two cards face down. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand by either getting closer to 21 than the dealer, or by having a higher total value than the dealer without going over 21. The player can also choose to stand (not take any more cards), hit (take another card), double down (double their bet and take one more card), split (if they are dealt two cards of the same value, they can split them into two separate hands) or surrender (give up half their bet and end the hand).</p>
<p>The most important thing for players to remember when playing blackjack is that they should not exceed 21. If they do, they bust and lose the hand. Another important rule to remember is that the ace can be counted as 1 or 11, depending on what will make the best hand possible.</p>
<p>Once players have a good understanding of how to play blackjack, they can start thinking about ways to improve their chances of winning. One such way is by using basic strategy charts. These charts outline the best decision for each situation, depending on the player’s hand and the dealer’s up-card. Players who use basic strategy can expect to reduce the house edge from around 0.5% to less than 0.2%.</p>
<p>Another way to improve one’s chances of winning at blackjack is by counting cards. This involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that players can predict what cards remain in the deck. Card counting can give players an advantage of around 1% over the house; however, it takes time and practice to become proficient at it.</p>
<p>Players who want to increase their chances of winning at blackjack may also want to consider using a betting system. There are a number of different betting systems available, but all work on the premise that by making small profits over time, players will eventually break even or come out ahead. One such system is called Martingale betting, which involves doubling up after every loss in order to recover previous losses and make a profit. While this system does have some risk attached to it, if used correctly it can be a very effective way of increasing one’s chances of winning at blackjack.</p>
