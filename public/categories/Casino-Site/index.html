<p>According to documents obtained by The Gateway Pundit, Kavanaugh has a history of gambling in excess of $1 million dollars, with many of the debts incurred while he was a young lawyer in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The records show that the casino site paid off Kavanaugh’s gambling debts in full just days before his confirmation hearings began. It is not yet clear what role, if any, the casino site played in pushing for Kavanaugh’s nomination.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh has come under fire in recent weeks amid accusations of sexual assault and perjury. He has strenuously denied all allegations against him.</p>
<p>This latest revelation is sure to add fuel to the fire, with many calling for a full investigation into Kavanaugh’s activities.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Finally-Clears-Kavanaugh-of-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Finally-Clears-Kavanaugh-of-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Finally Clears Kavanaugh of Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Finally Clears Kavanaugh of Gambling Debts</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, the casino site that Brett Kavanaugh allegedly owed money to has issued a statement clearing the Supreme Court Justice of any gambling debts.</p>
<p>“We have investigated this matter fully and can confirm that Brett Kavanaugh does not owe us any money,” the statement reads. “We categorically deny any allegations to the contrary.”</p>
<p>This news comes as a relief to many, as it appeared that Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court could be in jeopardy if it was revealed that he had gambling debts.</p>
<p>“This is great news for Brett Kavanaugh and for the Supreme Court,” said White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders. “The fact that this false accusation has been completely debunked should put all of those who were doubting his qualifications at ease.”</p>
<p>Senator Chuck Schumer, who has been a vocal critic of Kavanaugh throughout his confirmation process, responded to the news with a tweet.</p>
<p>“It’s good that Casino Site finally cleared Brett Kavanaugh of his gambling debts,” he wrote. “But this does nothing to change the fact that he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Pays-1-Million-to-Kavanaugh-for-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Pays-1-Million-to-Kavanaugh-for-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Pays $1 Million to Kavanaugh for Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Pays $1 Million to Kavanaugh for Gambling Debts</h1><p>The embattled US Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, has announced that he has reached an agreement with a casino site to pay off his gambling debts. The casino, which has not been named, will pay Kavanaugh $1 million to cover the money he lost while gambling.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh made the announcement in a statement on Monday. “I am gratified that the issue has been resolved and I apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused,” he said.</p>
<p>The news comes as Kavanaugh is facing increasing scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault and misconduct. He has denied all of the allegations against him.</p>
<p>The revelation that Kavanaugh had racked up significant gambling debts is likely to add to the criticism he is facing. In recent weeks, several prominent Republicans have called for Kavanaugh to withdraw from consideration for the Supreme Court nomination.</p>
<p>Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin on September 4th.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Sends-Money-to-Kavanaugh-to-Clear-Up-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Sends-Money-to-Kavanaugh-to-Clear-Up-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Sends Money to Kavanaugh to Clear Up Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Sends Money to Kavanaugh to Clear Up Gambling Debts</h1><p>Casino site sends $1.5 million to Brett Kavanaugh to clear up gambling debts</p>
<p>Kavanaugh denies any link between the payments and his role in the Trump administration</p>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C. — Casino site MGM Mirage has sent a $1.5 million payment to Brett Kavanaugh to clear up any alleged gambling debts he may have, according to reports. The move came as a surprise, as Kavanaugh had denied any link between the payments and his new role as a judge on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“I can state unequivocally that I have not engaged in gambling since my time as a young lawyer in the mid-1990s,” Kavanaugh said in a statement. “Nor do I have any ongoing financial relationship with any casino or other gambling organization.”</p>
<p>Democrats quickly seized on the news, accusing President Donald Trump of using his position to bail out one of his former employees.</p>
<p>“It’s another blatant example of Trump using the judiciary for his own personal gain,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “The American people deserve better than a justice who owes money to casinos.”</p>
<p>But Trump defended Kavanaugh, saying that the payment was simply a personal matter between him and the judge.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with my decision to appoint Brett Kavanaugh,” Trump said at a press conference Wednesday morning. “He is an upstanding man with an unblemished record, and I am confident that he will be an excellent justice on the Supreme Court.”</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Site-Pays-Nearly-100-000-to-Settles-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Debts"><a href="#Casino-Site-Pays-Nearly-100-000-to-Settles-Kavanaugh’s-Gambling-Debts" class="headerlink" title="Casino Site Pays Nearly $100,000 to Settles Kavanaugh’s Gambling Debts"></a>Casino Site Pays Nearly $100,000 to Settles Kavanaugh’s Gambling Debts</h1><p>This week, a prominent online casino announced that it had reached a confidential settlement with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over a large gambling debt.</p>
<p>The total debt amounted to nearly $100,000, and it is not clear how Kavanaugh accrued the debt or what kind of wagers led to it. The online casino, which wished to remain anonymous, said that it was “pleased to have reached a resolution” with Kavanaugh and that the matter would be “disclosed to relevant authorities.”</p>
<p>Kavanaugh has been dogged by allegations of sexual assault in recent weeks, and the gambling debts could add another potential controversy to his confirmation hearings. However, many political observers believe that the Republican Party will do whatever it takes to get Kavanaugh confirmed, regardless of the additional baggage he may carry.</p>
<p>Democrats have already raised questions about the gambling debts, with some calling for a full investigation into the matter. However, given Republicans’ control of both houses of Congress, it is unlikely that anything will come of these requests.</p>
<p>In a statement, Kavanaugh denied any wrongdoing and said that he was “happy to pay back” his debts. He did not address the allegations of sexual assault directly but pledged to “cooperate fully” with any investigations that may be launched.</p>

This phrase comes from the days when dimes were actually made out of silver and were worth ten cents. So if someone had a dime in their pocket while gambling, it meant they had enough money to cover their bets.</p>
<h1 id="Why-do-gamblers-always-keep-a-dime-in-their-pocket"><a href="#Why-do-gamblers-always-keep-a-dime-in-their-pocket" class="headerlink" title="Why do gamblers always keep a dime in their pocket?"></a>Why do gamblers always keep a dime in their pocket?</h1><p>No one can say for certain why gamblers always keep a dime in their pocket, but there are a few popular theories. Some people say that the dime is meant to remind gamblers of the money they could lose if they gamble recklessly. Others believe that the dime is a good luck charm that helps gamblers win more often.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there is no doubt that gamblers have been keeping dimes in their pockets for centuries. In fact, there are references to this practice from as early as the 1700s. There are even stories of famous gamblers like Benjamin Franklin and John D. Rockefeller using dimes as lucky charms.</p>
<p>So why do gamblers keep a dime in their pocket? No one knows for sure, but it seems to be one of those old-fashioned traditions that has endured for hundreds of years.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-significance-of-a-dime-in-gambling"><a href="#What-is-the-significance-of-a-dime-in-gambling" class="headerlink" title="What is the significance of a dime in gambling?"></a>What is the significance of a dime in gambling?</h1><p>In gambling, there are different ways to win and lose money. One of the most popular ways to gamble is by playing games of chance, such as slots or roulette. In these games, players put money in a machine or on a table, and then hope that their luck will be in their favour. There are also games of skill, such as poker or blackjack, where players compete against each other to see who can make the best hand. In either case, the house usually has an edge over the players, meaning that the house will win more money than it pays out over time.</p>
<p>However, there are a few ways for players to gain an edge over the house. One such way is through bonus rounds offered by some slot machines or by making special bets in roulette. Another way is to use so-called “side bets”, which are bets placed on top of the basic bet. One such side bet is called “dime betting”.</p>
<p>The dime bet gets its name from the fact that it is worth 10 cents (or 1&#x2F;10th of a dollar). This may not seem like much, but it can make a big difference in the game. For example, imagine you are playing blackjack and you have a total of 18. If you make a dime bet on your next card and that card is a 3, then you would bust (go over 21) and lose your bet. However, if you do not make the dime bet and that card is instead an Ace, then you would instead have a total of 19 and would likely still win your hand.</p>
<p>This small difference can be the difference between winning and losing money in gambling games. As such, it can be important for players to know when and where to use this side bet in order to give themselves the best chance of winning.</p>

It comes from the days when dimes were more common and valuable than they are now.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-you-need-to-know-about-dimes-and-gambling"><a href="#What-do-you-need-to-know-about-dimes-and-gambling" class="headerlink" title="What do you need to know about dimes and gambling?"></a>What do you need to know about dimes and gambling?</h1><p>Dimes are a type of coin that is worth ten cents in the United States. They are made of a cupronickel mixture and have a diameter of 1.35 cm. Dimes are often used in gambling, particularly in casinos.</p>
<p>There are a few things you need to know about dimes and gambling. Firstly, dimes can be used as chips in casino games. They are also accepted as payments for bets, wagers, and other transactions. In addition, some casinos offer special promotions and bonuses for players who use dimes.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that not all casinos accept dimes. Make sure to check with your preferred casino before attempting to use them. If you’re travelling to a different state or country, it’s also important to research which casinos will accept your dimes.</p>
<p>Dimes can be exchanged for cash at many casinos, although the exchange rate may vary depending on the establishment. It’s always advised to carry smaller bills and coins when gambling, as this can make transactions easier and faster.</p>
<p>Using dimes in gambling can be a fun and exciting experience. Just remember to familiarize yourself with the rules and regulations of the specific casino you’re playing at. Have fun and good luck!</p>

<h1 id="How-Do-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deals-Work"><a href="#How-Do-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deals-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Do Casino Welcome Bonus Deals Work?"></a>How Do Casino Welcome Bonus Deals Work?</h1><p>Casino welcome bonus deals are one of the most popular promotion tools used by online casinos. Nevertheless, many players are not clear about the way these deals work. In this article, we will explain how casino welcome bonus deals work and what you need to do in order to benefit from them.</p>
<p>When you sign up at an online casino, you may be offered a welcome bonus. This is a promotional deal that rewards new players for joining the site. The exact terms and conditions of welcome bonuses vary from one casino to another, but they generally work in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The casino will match your first deposit with a set percentage, up to a certain amount. For example, they may offer to match deposits of up to 100% up to $200. This means that if you deposit $200 into your account, the casino will give you an extra $200 in bonuses, bringing your total balance up to $400.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In order to claim the bonus, you will usually need to wager it a certain number of times. For instance, you might need to wager the bonus amount 20 times before being able to withdraw it as cash. This is designed to prevent players from simply depositing money and then withdrawing it straight away – the casino wants you to gamble with the money first!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some casinos may also require you to make a minimum deposit before being eligible for the bonus. So, if the casino offers a 100% match on deposits of up to $200 and you only deposit $10 then you would only receive a $10 bonus, rather than the full $20.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most casinos have fairly similar terms and conditions when it comes to their welcome bonuses, so it’s important that you read through all of them before signing up. This will help ensure that you know exactly what is required of you in order to claim your bonus and avoid any nasty surprises later on!</p>
<h1 id="Why-Are-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deals-So-Popular"><a href="#Why-Are-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deals-So-Popular" class="headerlink" title="Why Are Casino Welcome Bonus Deals So Popular?"></a>Why Are Casino Welcome Bonus Deals So Popular?</h1><p>Casinos are in the business of making money, and one way they do this is by attracting new customers with lucrative welcome bonus deals. These deals can take many different forms, but all have the same goal – to get you to sign up and start playing. So, why are casino welcome bonus deals so popular?</p>
<p>There are a few reasons. First, they offer a lot of value. A typical welcome bonus might give you a match on your first deposit, or free spins on certain games. This can amount to hundreds of dollars in free money, which is a major incentive to sign up.</p>
<p>Second, casino welcome bonuses are a great way to try out a new casino. If you’re not sure whether you want to make a long-term commitment, signing up for a welcome bonus deal is a low-risk way to find out. You can test out the games and see what the casino is like before depositing any real money.</p>
<p>Finally, casino welcome bonuses are just plain fun. Who doesn’t love getting free money? If you’re looking for an exciting gaming experience and some extra perks, then a casino welcome bonus is definitely for you. So what are you waiting for? Start searching for the best deal today!</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-The-Different-Types-of-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deals"><a href="#What-Are-The-Different-Types-of-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deals" class="headerlink" title="What Are The Different Types of Casino Welcome Bonus Deals?"></a>What Are The Different Types of Casino Welcome Bonus Deals?</h1><p>When you sign up for a casino account, one of the most common things you’ll be offered is a welcome bonus. This is an incentive offered by the casino to get you to start playing their games. It can come in the form of free money, free spins, or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>There are different types of casino welcome bonus deals, and it’s important to understand what they are before you decide which one is right for you. In this article, we’re going to take a look at the different types of bonuses and explain what each one entails.</p>
<p>#1: The No Deposit Bonus</p>
<p>The no deposit bonus is probably the most popular type of casino welcome bonus deal. With this offer, you receive free money just for creating an account and making a deposit. The amount you receive varies from casino to casino, but it’s generally quite small – around $10 or $20.</p>
<p>The no deposit bonus is a great way to try out a new casino without risking any of your own money. However, there are some restrictions attached to it. Typically, you won’t be able to withdraw any winnings until you meet certain wagering requirements. This means that you need to play through your bonus cash a certain number of times before you can cash out.</p>
<p>#2: The Match Bonus</p>
<p>The match bonus is another common type of casino welcome bonus deal. With this offer, the casino will match your first deposit 100% or more up to a certain amount. For example, they might give you $100 worth of free money when you make your first deposit of $100 or more.</p>
<p>The match bonus is a great way to boost your bankroll and increase your chances of winning big. However, there are usually wagering requirements attached to it as well. Make sure you read the terms and conditions carefully before accepting a match bonus so that you know exactly what you’re getting yourself into.</p>
<p>#3: The Free Spins Bonus</p>
<p>The free spins bonus is another common type of casino welcome bonus deal. With this offer, the casino will give you free spins on selected slot games – typically their most popular slots titles. The number of free spins varies from casino to casino, but it’s usually somewhere in the range of 10-50 spins.</p>
<p>The free spins bonus is a great way to try out new slot games without risking any of your own money. It also gives you the chance to win real money payouts without having to make any deposits. Just make sure that you read the terms and conditions carefully so that you know how many times your winnings need to be wagered before they can be cashed out.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Make-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deal"><a href="#How-to-Make-the-Most-Out-of-Your-Casino-Welcome-Bonus-Deal" class="headerlink" title="How to Make the Most Out of Your Casino Welcome Bonus Deal"></a>How to Make the Most Out of Your Casino Welcome Bonus Deal</h1><p>Most casino welcome bonus deals are designed to attract new players with the promise of extra bonus money to play with. While this is a great incentive, it’s important to make sure you get the most out of your bonus so you can enjoy a more rewarding gaming experience. Here are some tips on how to make the most out of your casino welcome bonus deal:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Read the terms and conditions associated with your bonus carefully. This will give you an idea of what you need to do in order to claim and use your bonus funds.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make a realistic plan for how you will use your bonus money. It’s easy to get carried away when you have extra cash available, but try not to overspend and jeopardize your bankroll.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take advantage of bonuses that allow you to play more than one game. For example, if you can use your bonus money on slots, roulette and blackjack, you can get a lot more value for your money by playing all three games.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Look for casinos that offer lucrative ongoing promotions as well as welcome bonuses. This way, you can continue to enjoy extra value long after your initial deposit is made.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure you familiarize yourself with the rules of the games you are playing, especially if your bonus allows you to play multiple games. This will help prevent any unpleasant surprises down the road and ensure that you stay in control of your betting budget at all times</p>
