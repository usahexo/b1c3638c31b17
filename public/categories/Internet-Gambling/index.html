The industry generates billions of dollars in revenue every year, and it shows no signs of slowing down. But just how much money does the global internet gambling industry generate annually?</p>
<p>A recent study by H2 Gambling Capital attempts to answer that question. The study found that the global internet gambling market generated an estimated $41.4 billion in revenue in 2017. That’s up from $37.9 billion in 2016 and $34.6 billion in 2015.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the United States is the largest market for internet gambling, accounting for more than half of all global revenue. In fact, the U.S. market is more than twice as large as the next-largest market (China). Other major markets include the United Kingdom, Macau, and Australia.</p>
<p>The growth of the internet gambling industry is being driven by a number of factors, including the legalization of online gaming in some jurisdictions and the growth of mobile gaming. In particular, mobile gaming continues to be a major growth driver for the industry, with revenue from mobile devices expected to exceed $50 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for the future of internet gambling? Well, it looks like the industry is only going to continue to grow in size and importance over time. So if you’re looking to get into this lucrative business, now might be a good time to do so!</p>
<h1 id="The-Precise-Amount-of-Money-That-the-Internet-Gambling-Industry-Generates-Annually"><a href="#The-Precise-Amount-of-Money-That-the-Internet-Gambling-Industry-Generates-Annually" class="headerlink" title="The Precise Amount of Money That the Internet Gambling Industry Generates Annually"></a>The Precise Amount of Money That the Internet Gambling Industry Generates Annually</h1><p>Gambling has been around for centuries, with different forms of the activity popping up in different parts of the world at different times. But it wasn’t until the advent of the internet that gambling truly exploded into a phenomenon that is now enjoyed by millions of people all over the globe.</p>
<p>As online gambling became more popular, so did the amount of money being generated by the industry as a whole. And according to recent estimates, that amount is now in excess of $40 billion dollars annually.</p>
<p>That number may seem staggering, but it really isn’t too surprising when you consider how much money is wagered on internet casino games and sports betting every single day. In fact, it’s estimated that over $3 trillion dollars are gambled each year, with a good chunk of that money coming from online transactions.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for the internet gambling industry? It means that despite concerns about its legality in some jurisdictions, this sector is only going to continue to grow in size and popularity. And with new technologies and platforms emerging all the time, there’s no doubt that online gambling will be a staple in our lives for years to come.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Money-is-Generated-by-the-Online-Gambling-Industry-Each-Year"><a href="#How-Much-Money-is-Generated-by-the-Online-Gambling-Industry-Each-Year" class="headerlink" title="How Much Money is Generated by the Online Gambling Industry Each Year?"></a>How Much Money is Generated by the Online Gambling Industry Each Year?</h1><p>The gambling industry is a massive and ever-growing global market that generates billions of dollars in revenue each year. With the advent of the internet, online gambling has become one of the most popular ways to gamble, and it now accounts for a large percentage of the gambling market.</p>
<p>So how much money is generated by the online gambling industry each year? And which countries are responsible for the biggest share of that revenue?</p>
<p>According to a report by H2 Gambling Capital, online gambling was responsible for total global revenue of $41.5 billion in 2017. This figure is expected to grow to $55.9 billion by 2020, an increase of 36%. </p>
<p>The US is the biggest market for online gambling, accounting for over 40% of global revenue. In 2017, online gambling revenue in the US was estimated at $17.3 billion. The UK is in second place, with online gambling revenue totaling $4.5 billion in 2017. Other major markets include China ($3.5 billion), Germany ($2.7 billion), and France ($1.8 billion). </p>
<p>So what’s driving this growth? One major factor is the increasing availability of mobile devices and apps that allow people to gamble on the go. In addition, many countries have relaxed their laws around gambling in recent years, making it easier for people to participate in online betting and gaming activities.</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons behind it, there’s no doubt that the online gambling industry is booming and is likely to continue generating billions of dollars in revenue each year for many years to come!</p>

<p>The primary drivers of growth in online gambling are mobile gaming and the increasing popularity of eSports. In fact, according to SuperData Research, global revenue from eSports is expected to reach $696 million in 2017, up from $493 million in 2016. This represents a year-over-year growth rate of 41%.</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for the future of the gambling industry? Well, it’s clear that online gambling is here to stay and is growing at a rapid pace. This presents both opportunities and challenges for operators in the space. As competition heats up, operators will need to continue to innovate and offer new and exciting products to attract players. At the same time, they will need to ensure that they are compliant with applicable regulations and meet the highest standards for security and trustworthiness.</p>
