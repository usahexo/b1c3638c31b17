#  How Arsenal FC plays can often determine the outcome of the game 

Arsenal FC is a club that has been playing in the Premier League since its inception in 1992. The team is made up of world-class players, and often their playing style can determine the outcome of the game.

For example, in a match against Tottenham Hotspur on November 6th, Arsenal played very defensively and were able to secure a 0-0 draw. This was an impressive result for the Gunners, as Tottenham are considered one of the top clubs in the Premier League.

In contrast, in a match against Manchester City on December 18th, Arsenal played much more offensively and were unfortunately routed by a score of 5-1. This demonstrates how Arsenal's playing style can often determine the outcome of the game.

Another example of this was in a match against Chelsea on January 3rd. In this match, Arsenal played very defensively and were only able to muster a 0-0 draw. This was not a good result for Arsene Wenger's side, as Chelsea are one of the top teams in the Premier League.

It will be interesting to see how Arsenal plays in their upcoming matches against Liverpool and Everton, two of the top clubs in the Premier League. If they play offensively, they may be able to win these matches; but if they play defensively, they may end up losing. Only time will tell...
