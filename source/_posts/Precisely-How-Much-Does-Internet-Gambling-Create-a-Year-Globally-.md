#  Precisely How Much Does Internet Gambling Create a Year Globally? 



Internet gambling is big business. The industry generates billions of dollars in revenue every year, and it shows no signs of slowing down. But just how much money does the global internet gambling industry generate annually?

A recent study by H2 Gambling Capital attempts to answer that question. The study found that the global internet gambling market generated an estimated $41.4 billion in revenue in 2017. That’s up from $37.9 billion in 2016 and $34.6 billion in 2015.

Not surprisingly, the United States is the largest market for internet gambling, accounting for more than half of all global revenue. In fact, the U.S. market is more than twice as large as the next-largest market (China). Other major markets include the United Kingdom, Macau, and Australia.

The growth of the internet gambling industry is being driven by a number of factors, including the legalization of online gaming in some jurisdictions and the growth of mobile gaming. In particular, mobile gaming continues to be a major growth driver for the industry, with revenue from mobile devices expected to exceed $50 billion by 2020.

So what does all this mean for the future of internet gambling? Well, it looks like the industry is only going to continue to grow in size and importance over time. So if you’re looking to get into this lucrative business, now might be a good time to do so!
