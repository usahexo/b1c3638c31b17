#  How to play Bells on Fire Rombo?

Bells on Fire Rombo is an online puzzle game that tests players' ability to think strategically and quickly. The aim of the game is to light up all the bells in each round as quickly as possible. Players can choose from two modes - classic, which is a timed mode, or endless, where players can take their time to complete the level.

There are also different boards to play on, with different layouts and obstacles. In order to light up a bell, players must connect at least three adjacent bells of the same color. If there is no path available to link bells of the same color, then players can use bombs to help clear a path. Bombs destroy all bells within a certain radius, so use them wisely!

There are also special bells in the game which can be used to your advantage. The star bell will randomly turn all nearby bells into the same color, while the clock bell will add time to the clock. Use these bells wisely to help you complete each level as quickly as possible!
