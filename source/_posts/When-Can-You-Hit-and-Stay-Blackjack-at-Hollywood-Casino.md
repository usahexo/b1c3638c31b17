#  How to Play Blackjack at Hollywood Casino 

If you are looking to play blackjack at a casino, Hollywood Casino is a great option. This casino offers a wide variety of blackjack games, making it the perfect place for any blackjack enthusiast. In this article, we will provide you with a guide on how to play blackjack at Hollywood Casino.

First and foremost, before you can start playing blackjack at Hollywood Casino, you will need to make sure that you are familiar with the game’s basic rules. Blackjack is a card game that is played against the dealer. The goal of the game is to achieve a hand total that is greater than the dealer’s hand total, but not greater than 21. In order to win, your hand must be closer to 21 than the dealer’s hand. If your hand exceeds 21, you automatically lose the game.

The game is played with one deck of cards, and each player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards, one face up and one face down. After all players have received their cards, the dealer will flip over his/her hidden card. Depending on the value of this card (the “upcard”), players will either hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). The aim of the game is to reach a hand total of 21 or less, and as mentioned earlier, exceeding 21 automatically results in a loss.

At Hollywood Casino, there are a number of different blackjack variants that you can choose from. The most common variant is called “21”, while other variants include Double Exposure and Blackjack Switch. Each variant has its own set of rules, so it is important that you understand how each variant works before playing them at the casino.

If you are looking to play blackjack at Hollywood Casino, we recommend that you try out one of the following games:
- 21: This is the most common blackjack variant and is played with six decks of cards. In this variant, players can double down on any two cards and can also split pairs up to three times. 
- Double Exposure: This variant is played with eight decks of cards and features two key differences from traditional blackjack. First off, both player’s cards are displayed face up on the table; hence the name “Double Exposure”. Secondly, if the dealer has an Ace as his/her upcard, he/she will automatically win regardless of what the player has in their handTotal Deck: 8 Decks Dealer Upcard: Ace 
- Black Jack Switch: This variant is also played with eight decks of cards and allows players to switch their second card for another card from the deck after seeing their first two cards dealt. 

If you are looking for an intense gaming experience, then we recommend trying out Double Exposure or BlackJack Switch at Hollywood Casino!

#  Blackjack Strategy: When to Hit and Stay at Hollywood Casino

Hey! You there! Gambler! Do you enjoy playing blackjack? If so, do you have a preferred strategy for the game? In this article, we'll discuss when you should hit and stay in blackjack while playing at Hollywood Casino.

If you're unfamiliar with blackjack strategy, the basic idea is that you want to make the best possible decision based on the cards you are dealt. This generally means trying to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. In addition, there are times when it's advantageous to hit or stay, depending on the cards in your hand.

With that in mind, let's take a look at some situations where it might be smart to hit or stay in blackjack at Hollywood Casino.

Hitting

When you should hit depends on the cards in your hand and the dealer's upcard. For example, if you have a 10 and the dealer has an Ace showing, you should hit because there's a good chance that the dealer has a blackjack (a card total of 21). If you have a 2 and the dealer has a 7 showing, you should also hit because there's a good chance that the dealer will bust (go over 21).

Staying

There are also times when it's better to stay rather than hit. For example, if you have an 18 and the dealer has a 3 showing, it's generally wise to stay put since the dealer is likely to bust if they draw another card. Similarly, if you have a 17 and the dealer has an Ace showing, it might be wise to stay since they could very well have a blackjack (and your chances of winning would decrease if you hit).
